👋🏽 reader. My name is [Ronard Luna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronardluna/) and I'm a Software Engineer.

Recently, I decided to improve my [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) skills. Experience 
has taught me that building projects is the best way to improve technology skills.


This repository will house a series of infrastructure projects built with `Terraform` with a 
special focus on the `Amazon Web Services (AWS)` cloud platform. Each project will have its own
README, along with comments to help explain the the created resources. 

**Projects**:
1. Postgres RDS Database instance with automated backups _(Storage & Data)_
2. Site-to-site (S2S) VPN AWS <-> Azure _(Networking)_
3. ???
